*Access keywords are added with classes or any blocks or definitions that change their meaning* 

*For example if there is a bank software is created in java then, the name of bank should be public so that every can access it's name from any where in program*

* So, what we do just add public keyword with that variable and make that public so that every one can access it's name*

*Let's discuss about Access Modifiers in Java in detail below*


**Types of Access Modifiers in Java**

*Now there are variety of access modifiers in java but, we categorize them into two types that are as follow*

1) Access Control Modifiers

2) Non Access Modifiers


1) Access Control Modifiers:

*Now there are four types of access control modifiers, that we can use to control the access*

These are as follow:

A) public

B) private

C) protected

D) default



A) public

*public is a keyword that helps to control the access of class, method or any other member*

*Now if any entity is declared as public than we can access that any where*

*It is now public. It is visible to the real world. You can also say that there in no privacy*

public class Test
{   //public class
	public String var = "Hello World";   //public variable

	public void helloWorld()
	{    // public method
     	System.out.println(var);
   	}
}


B) private

*private is a keyword that we use to declare any entity as private*

*Now any entity declared as private cannot be access from any where*

*It is totally hide from the real world. For example pin of account is totally private. It is used to make our entity secure*

public class Test
{   	//Outer class can not be private
	private String var = "Hello World"; //private variable
      
      	private void helloWorld()
	{ 	// private method
      		System.out.println(var);
      }
 }


C) protected

*protected keyword help us to declare any entity as protected*

*Now any entity declared as protected can be access with in a package*

*As well as we can also access the child class through inheritance*

public class Test
{  	//Outer class cannot be protected     
    	protected String var = "Hello World"; //protected variable      
    	protected void helloWorld()
	{ 	// protected method
         	System.out.println(var);
     	}
}


D) default

*There in no keyword for default access modifiers* 

*If we write nothing than it is considered as default access modifier*

*Now any entity declared as default can only be access with in a package*



2) Non Access Modifiers

*There are bunch of non access modifiers in java that we can also use* 

So let's discuss about them in more detail below:

I) First of all we have "static modifier". That we mostly use with class or methods.

II) Then we have "final modifier" that we can use to make our variables or class or methods finalize.

III) The "abstract modifier" that we us to make our class or methods abstract.
